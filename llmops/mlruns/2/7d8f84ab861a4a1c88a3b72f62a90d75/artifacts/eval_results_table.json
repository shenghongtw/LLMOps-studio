Rising global temperatures have led to more frequent extreme weather events including hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Polar ice caps are melting faster than predicted, contributing to sea level rise that threatens coastal communities. Scientists warn that without immediate and dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, many of these changes may become irreversible.

It successfully mapped all of the genes of the human genome, approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in total. The project cost nearly $3 billion but has enabled countless medical advances and spawned new fields like pharmacogenomics.
